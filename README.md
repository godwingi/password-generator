# Random Password Generator

## Description

This application allows the user to generate a password by selecting the criteria they wish to have for their password. The criteria consists of users selecting a length for their password between 8 to 128, followed by whether they would like lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and/or special characters.

This application would be useful for users who would like secure passwords for any of their online applications.

There are many things that can be learned from completing a password generator, such as the order and scope of variable and functions, making sure all conditions are met, and debugging errors using the inspect tool, along with the console and debugger.
